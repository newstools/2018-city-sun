Economic Freedom Fighter leader Julius Malema has vowed to vote with the ANC on a motion of no confidence to remove DA mayor Anthol Trollip. “On April 6‚ the day of Jan van Riebeecks’ arrival‚ the day of the formation of the PAC of Robert Sobukwe and the hanging of Solomon Mahlangu … in honour of these people and also as a demonstration of the seriousness about this issue of land‚ we will be passing a motion of no confidence in the mayor as a warning shot to the DA,” said Julius Malema.

Malema said the ANC met all conditions given to it by the EFF during negotiations in 2016. These conditions were that Zuma must go‚ Die Stem must fall‚ one capital city‚ Gupta commission and free education. “The ANC seems to be meeting all of the conditions we have given them during those negotiations‚” said Malema. “We gave the same conditions to the DA and the DA seems not to be meeting any of the conditions we have given them on why they should run the metros and they are forever drifting away from the EFF,” said Malema. DA leader Mmusi Maimane took to social media and expressed his disappointment after Malema’s statements. “The removal of a government working for people in NMB is indeed a great tragedy. Our policy for land reform was always well known, and was known prior to election. We have in each municipality redistributed more land than previous administrations,” said Maimane.
