The leader of the Democratic Alliance Mmusi Maimane has vowed to bring a vote of no confidence against ANC Secretary, Ace Magashule who is also the premier of Free State. This comes after his office was raided by the Hawks in connection with Vrede Dairy farm scandal. Gupta email leaks revealed that large sums of money was redirected from a government funded dairy farm project to pay the family’s Sun City wedding. The Asset Forfeiture Unit obtained a preservation order with regards to the more than 4,000 hectares of farm land and the more than R220 million in several bank accounts linked to the Guptas.
