 Raids are currently underway at both the office of the premier Ace Magashule and provincial office of the department of agriculture. According to The Citizens news report published today, Hawks are looking for information related to Vrede Dairy Project. Earlier reports linked the Gupta family to the project. This comes after the Bloemfontein High Court granted the NPA’s Asset Forfeiture Unit a preservation order to freeze assets amounting to R220 million as well as the Krynaauwlust Farm in Vrede in the Free State, which the Guptas allegedly siphoned taxpayers monies from the project for their personal gain. More updates to follow. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); comments
