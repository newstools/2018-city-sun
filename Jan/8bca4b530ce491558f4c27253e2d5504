 The DA leader Mmusi Maimane has been criticized for distributing buckets to white suburbs only and ignored townships where black and colored people live. Maimane who is now known as a Social Media Minister took to Facebook where he posted his pictures as he was distributing water buckets to white citizens from Constantia. According to figures released by the City of Cape Town, Constantia is full of wasteful water users who are refusing to comply with orders issued by the municipality.

Handed out buckets to residents in areas where many are still not saving enough water. Every day that we exceed the target of 50l per person, we will bring Day Zero closer. Let’s unite together to defeat Day Zero.” But this did not go down well to residents of townships like Gugulethu, Khayelitsha, Nyanga, Langa and Mitchel’s Plain residents who soon took to social media to express their anger.  comments
